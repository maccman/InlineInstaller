Installer idea


Problem: Installing programs is complicated for non-computer literate people and requires too many steps. We want a standardized cross platform way of installing programs in-browser. This will also increase conversion.

Solution: Framework that can be bundled with applications. Allows websites to offer downloads in a way similar to Adobe Air:

Badge with point to action (Download)
If framework is detected, install in browser.

Features:
Install in browser
Update in browser
Detect if app is installed (offer updates)
JavaScript/Flash API
Cross platform (Linux/OSX/Win)
Expose platform information in plugin
Platform type (osx/linux/win)
Platform architecture (32/64 bit)

How will it work? 

Browser plugin built in - http://code.google.com/p/firebreath/
Exposes JavaScript API (below). 
Apps use the JS api to provide a badge, allowing an in-browser install.
Considerations

Must be very small & inexpensive.

Developer framework shared between applications, viral in other words.

Documented API - make a standard?

Security! Limited system access. Need to display a prominent message to the user. We could use certificates to prove authenticity.

Can we tap into the way Adobe Air is installed?

Names?

curl
zlib
Questions

What kind of programs could be installed ?
Any

API
